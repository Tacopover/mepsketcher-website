                <h2>Consumer Right to Cancel (14-Day Right of Withdrawal)</h2>
                <p>If you are a consumer and have purchased a license or subscription for MEPSketcher, you have the right to cancel your order within 14 days without giving any reason, unless an exception applies.</p>
                <p><strong>Cancellation Period:</strong> The 14-day cancellation period expires 14 days after the day following completion of your transaction.</p>
                <p><strong>How to Cancel:</strong> To cancel your order, contact us through our <a href="support.html">support page</a> and clearly communicate your decision to cancel.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h2>Effect of Cancellation</h2>
                <p>If you exercise your right to cancel:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We will reimburse all payments received from you</li>
                    <li>The reimbursement will be made without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after we receive your cancellation request</li>
                    <li>The refund will use the same payment method as your original transaction</li>
                    <li>You will not incur any fees for the reimbursement</li>

                <h2>Exception to Cancellation Rights</h2>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Digital Content Exception:</strong> Your right to cancel does not apply to digital content (such as software licenses) that you have already downloaded, streamed, or otherwise begun to acquire, or to products that you have had the benefit of.
                </div>
                <p>If you have already downloaded and begun using your MEPSketcher license, you may not be eligible for a refund under the standard cancellation right.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h2>General Refund Policy</h2>
                <p>Beyond the 14-day consumer right to cancel, refunds are provided at Paddle's sole discretion on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                <p><strong>Refund Eligibility:</strong> Refund requests may be refused if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Consumer Protection:</strong> This does not affect your rights as a consumer in relation to products which are not as described, faulty, or not fit for purpose, in accordance with applicable consumer protection laws.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h2>Pre-Orders</h2>
                <p>If you pre-order a product, you will be charged upfront. You may request a refund for any reason until the content is delivered. After delivery, the standard refund policy applies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
                <h3>Automatic Renewal</h3>

                <h3>Cancellation Process</h3>
                <p>To cancel your subscription, contact us through our <a href="support.html">support page</a> at least 48 hours before the end of your current billing period. Provide your order number and the email address associated with your purchase.</p>
                <h3>Unused Periods</h3>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h2>Sales Tax Refunds</h2>
                <p>If you have been charged sales tax on your purchase and are registered for sales tax in the country of purchase, you may be entitled to a refund of the sales tax amount if permitted by local law.</p>
                <p>Sales taxes include VAT, GST, Consumption Tax, and others as applicable. You must contact Paddle within 60 days of purchase to be eligible for a sales tax refund, and you must provide a valid sales tax code for your country.</p>
                <p>All refund requests received after 60 days will not be processed.</p>
            </div>
